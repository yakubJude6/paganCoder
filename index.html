          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>
            Thank you for coming to my blog! My name is P≈ôemysl ƒåern√Ω and I work
            as a software developer in the area of cyber security and artificial
            intelligence. Since I am passionate about nature, science, stories
            including those of ancient European gods and mythology, old history
            and some parts of ancient Greco-Roman pagan philosophy leading to
            modern concepts of atoms and technology in general, I devised myself
            the title ‚ÄúPagan Coder‚Äù. I would like to share with you not only the
            coding topics, but also other thoughts related to nature, science
            and history. I live in a woodland area named K≈ôivokl√°tsko in Czech,
            or the Forest of Crooked Logs, which is very rich both in nature
            (geodiversity and biodiversity) and history going back to the time
            of Celts, Bronze Age settlements and first Neolithic farmers. All
            those people, majority of whom are our common ancestors, would be
            considered as ‚Äúpagans‚Äù from the modern perspective, with their ideas
            of natural forces, stories about gods, heroes and magical properties
            of trees, herbs and other parts of nature as well as their weapons
            and tools.

            I live three kilometers from the castle of K≈ôivokl√°t. It was built
            on a sacred rock at the beginning of 12th century, though there was
            possibly a wooden fortress before. The place was extensively used in
            the Late Bronze Age.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope you will find useful information and tutorials here related
            to coding in the cyber security and artificial intelligence world,
            which is going to influence our daily lives more and more. The old
            stories, philosophy and especially the forests as well as my own
            small garden, wife and children serve as a huge inspiration for me,
            so I would like to also share with you personal thoughts and
            pictures both from my personal and professional life. Software
            development requires a lot of understanding and thinking, but, in my
            opinion, it offers a very exciting and rewarding career with the
            possibility to work anywhere on the planet just using the internet
            connection and your laptop. When you are deploying your programs or
            waiting for the result of some data analysis, you can write stories,
            poems, songs, play with your children, observe nature, go for a
            walk, listen to singing birds, smell the blossoms of plants and
            fruit trees in an orchard just at the edge of a forest, just
            anything that inspires you and brings you joy. What other human
            endeavor offers you to do so in the modern times? üòâ

            The summer solstice has been celebrated since prehistory. St. John‚Äòs
            wort is the most famous, soothing herb associated with summer
            solstice in the Baltoslavic area, as well as rivers and high fires.

            Most of my coding is done in C, asynchronous Python and their
            connection via Cython. Other languages I may use on this blog
            include LLVM for optimization of the code to assembly-like language,
            C++, Go, JavaScript (React) and Kotlin (Android). From the open
            source technologies I will be mentioning Docker, Kafka,
            ElasticSearch and other technologies that I use in cooperation with
            TeskaLabs company. Some of the things like parallel programming and
            memory management I first learned while (successfully) studying for
            a master degree at Faculty of information technology at Czech
            technical university in Prague.

            I do not want to provide comprehensive articles, but just hints and
            pieces of code people can immediately use for their work and study,
            while I also mention their use cases in the cyber security,
            stream/data analytics and artificial intelligence fields. There are
            many detailed tutorials on the Internet and discussions on
            well-known sites, so it would be superfluous to do so here. On the
            other hand, I will try to mention some interesting correlations
            among the described topics, that are harder to find via search
            engines, or that are hidden in quantities of long texts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coding overlaps both with nature and story writing. There are many
            cases where systems or even small applications help scientists
            better understand the world around us. That is also why I used to
            work part-time for the Czech society of ornithology, where I helped
            to develop a mobile application connected to a bird database to see
            the distribution of individual species, their age and nests in the
            Czech Republic. The data were then analyzed by ornithologists to see
            which species needed protection and even how the landscape changes,
            since birds are a good indicator of the state of the environment
            (the distribution of agricultural, forest and water birds reflects
            the decrease or increase of such areas)

            Learning new architectural patterns in software development
            strengthens the imagination, learning of programming and computer
            languages leads to better understanding of actual human languages,
            their syntax and semantics. Personally, I am very interested in the
            family of languages of the people once inhabiting K≈ôivokl√°tsko,
            especially Baltoslavic, Celtic and Indo-European in general. During
            the years of 2017-2019 I was part of the chairman committee of
            Friends of Lusatia company in Prague, because of my interest in the
            Sorbian languages. I am also interested in Gaelic languages,
            especially Irish. My author name is ‚ÄúP≈ôemysl L√∫a ƒåern√Ω‚Äù, L√∫a being
            the diminutive of Celtic Lugudecos, reflected in Irish ‚ÄúLughaidh‚Äù or
            continental Galic feminine version ‚ÄúLucudeca‚Äù

            Triskelions resemble protons or neutrons with each having three
            swirling quarks surrounded by gluons. Though the Bronze Age people
            nor the Celts, unlike ancient Greeks, had no idea of atoms, their
            art is illustrative especially today. Without the knowledge of atoms
            there would be no computers in the modern sense.
          </p>

            In the Czech language, I created two websites dedicated to nature,
            history and folk (as well as my own) tales. One of them is dedicated
            to the K≈ôivokl√°tsko region and is called K≈ôivokl√°tsk√© smƒõsi (The
            Brews of the Forest of Crooked Logs). I share pictures and thoughts
            from the region there, especially related to old trees, mycorrhizal
            networks (cooperation among trees and fungi), plants, soil
            organisms, gardening, hillforts and so on. While most of the content
            is written purely in Czech, the introductory article is also
            available in English:
            <a class="link" href="https://www.krivoklatskesmesi.cz/the-brews-of-the-forest-of-crooked-logs/">https://www.krivoklatskesmesi.cz/the-brews-of-the-forest-of-crooked-logs//</a>
    </p>
            <p>
              Another site I created is more general in the focus on the entire
              Baltoslavic area, however I do not update it anymore, only share
              interesting archaeological findings. The website is called ‚ÄúVindov√©‚Äù
              and based on its stories I wrote a book in Czech named ‚ÄúThe Golden
              Heart: The Story of Land and Ancestors‚Äù. You can read about the page
              and the book in an English summary: <a class="link" href="https://www.vindove.cz/shrnuti-summary/">https://www.vindove.cz/shrnuti-summary/</a>

               Both names, P≈ôemysl and Lughaidh, were used by mythical dukes/kings,
                         Bohemian Premyslid dynasty derives its name from one of them, though
                         it is used by modern historians, not the members of the dynasty
                         themselves.
